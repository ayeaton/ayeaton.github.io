      <p> I a newly minted PhD :) now also a computational biologist at the Broad Institute! During my PhD, I was supervised by 
        Iannis Aifantis and Aristotelis Tsirigos. I was interested in single-cell RNAseq anlysis and
        applications of deep learning to histopathology images. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote a wrapper package for our lab with my labmate Igor Dolgalev called 
        <a href="https://github.com/igordot/scooter">scooter</a> and an RMarkdown pipeline called <a href="https://github.com/ayeaton/scooterRMD">scooterRMD</a> 
        to streamline and clean up standard scRNAseq analysis steps. I wrote a paper using this code base with my co-authors in the Aifantis lab. The paper is currently under revision. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also contributed to the code base for the image anlysis and deep learning projects in the Tsirigos lab. This work is currently contained in private Github repositories, 
        but has contributed to papers accepted to MICCAI, and current ongoing work in the lab.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the summer of 2021, I did an internship at Microsoft Research. I worked on applications of optimal transport to histopathology datasets. I have written a paper based on my 
        internship work which has accepted to MIDL. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests are now shifting towards spatial biology, Bayesian statistics, geospatial analysis, and graphs. </p>
      <p>
        I have also spent a considerable effort creating teaching materials for our Machine Learning class. I hope to clean up and release the material soon.
